# New platform -> http://translate.logitycoon.com
Please go to our better translation platform and login with your Github account or create an account there.

## What if I want to check how the translation is in-game? ##
When all the files for a language have been translated, they will be placed in the game as a Beta translation. After this, the language files can still be changed and they will be updated to the game every now and then.

## Questions? ##
Any questions? Feel free to send me an e-mail: info@logitycoon.com
